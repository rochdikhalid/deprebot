# Astrobot (in progress)
A deep learning chatbot built with **Tensorflow** and **Keras**, it simulates human conversation to help you boost your mental health in case you are experiencing symptoms of a mental health condition. These conditions can range from depression and anxiety or even addiction, and all of these could shape our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. 

## Setup

* **1-** Go to the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/) to install **Anaconda**, it's preferable to have the latest version of **Python** for an appropriate architecture.

* **2-** Use the **requirement.txt** file to install the dependencies:

      pip install -r requirements.txt
      
* **3-** Use **Jupyter** or **Jupyter lab** to open up the notebook.

* **4-** Run the **run.py** file to test and start the conversation with **Astro**.
